AI Flight Advisory System

A full-stack application that provides pilots with AI-generated route recommendations based on real-time weather data between two airports. It features a 3D interactive globe to visualize selected routes and weather conditions.

Features

3D interactive globe (using react-globe.gl)

Airport selection & route visualization

Real-time weather data via OpenWeatherMap

AI-generated flight briefings with Gemini Pro (Google)

Backend powered by Flask + Python

CORS-enabled API routing and JSON response handling

AI Briefing Logic

The backend compiles weather info for two airports and sends it as a prompt to Gemini. The response includes:

Detailed weather summaries

Route feasibility

Takeoff/landing considerations

Risk level & safety notes
